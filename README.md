# 3DHIP-Calculator-v1.1

**3DHIP-Calculator** is a new standalone software written in MATLAB R2019 developed by the Area of Geological Resources of the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya (ICGC)
in colaboration with the Unit of Geotectonics, Department of Geology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB).

The new tool allows do assessments of deep geothermal potential by calculating the USGS "Heat-in-Place (HIP)" (Muffler and Cataldi, 1978) 
from 3D geological and thermal voxel models with a probabilistic or stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo simulations.

In this folder you can distinguish two main folders:

	i.3DHIP_executable v_1.1. : Which contains the standalone executable MATLAB-based software compiled for Microsoft Windows™ (3DHIP_Calculator.exe). 	During 	the installation MATLAB libraries will be automatically downloaded and installed to correctly run the app. To install the app just double click on the executable file and follow the installation instructions. Al the files described in the next folder are compiled in the standalone executable.

	ii.3DHIP_v1.1._files: Which contains the source code in MATLAB and different files to use the 3DHIP-Calculator v1.1. 

		a.3DHIP_Calculator_Software_User_Manual_v1.1.pdf. Is the software manual
		b.HIP_Calculator.mlapp. Is the MATLAB app. To use it, just open it from the MATLAB software. Both graphical interface and code view can be 				acceded.
		c.Image files used in the HIP_Calculator.mlapp
