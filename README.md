# 3DHIP-Calculator App 
 
## Stochastic assessment and mapping of deep geothermal potential using 3D voxel-based geological models

**3DHIP-Calculator** is a new standalone software written in MATLAB language R2019 developed by the Area of Geological Resources of the Institut Cartogràfic i Geològic de Catalunya (ICGC) in colaboration with the Unit of Geotectonics, Department of Geology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB).

The tool allows to assess the deep geothermal energy potential of hot deep aquifers from 3D geological and thermal voxel models. The App applies the USGS "Heat-in-Place (HIP)" method (Muffler and Cataldi, 1978) using a stochastic approach based on Monte Carlo simulations.

**Instructions about the content of the repository of the current version 3DHIP-Calculator v1.1 (December 2020)**

In this folder you can distinguish two main folders:

 - **3DHIP_executable v_1.1** folder : Which contains the standalone executable MATLAB-based software compiled for Microsoft Windows™ (3DHIP_Calculator.exe). During 	the installation MATLAB libraries will be automatically downloaded and installed to correctly run the app. To install the app just double click on the executable file and follow the installation instructions. Al the files described in the next folder are compiled in the standalone executable.
 - **3DHIP_v1.1._files** folder: Which contains the source code and other different files to use the 3DHIP-Calculator v1.1. in MATLAB. 

	 - 3DHIP_Calculator_Software_User_Manual_v1.1.pdf: The software manual in PDF
	 - HIP_Calculator.mlapp: **the source code** *.mlapp file for the App Designer in MATLAB. To use it, just click and the app designer script will open into MATLAB. Both graphical interface and code view can be acceded.
